Hi, I'm Jesus Rosario. I'm a developer who enjoys building fast, interactive, and beautiful web experiences.

This blog serves as my digital garden—a place where I plant ideas, nurture them through writing, and occasionally watch them blossom into larger projects. 

### What You'll Find Here

- **Technical deep dives** into modern web development
- **Design patterns** and architectural explorations
- **Musings** on the intersection of technology and art

Feel free to look around and read some of my recent posts!
