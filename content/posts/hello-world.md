Welcome to my first post on **Jesus Blog**!

When deciding how to build this blog, I wanted something fast, reliable, and completely within my control. While platforms like Medium and Substack are great for reach, you don't truly *own* your content. 

By building a static blog powered by Next.js and Markdown, I get the best of both worlds:

1. **Performance:** The site is statically generated at build time, meaning it's blazing fast.
2. **Simplicity:** Writing in Markdown is frictionless. No clunky WYSIWYG editors, just plain text.
3. **Control:** I host this on GitHub Pages for free, and my content lives in version control alongside the code.

### The Stack

This blog uses:
- **Next.js (App Router)** for building the React framework.
- **gray-matter** for parsing frontmatter yaml.
- **react-markdown** and **remark-gfm** for rendering markdown natively in React with syntax highlighting.
- Vanilla CSS for a custom, tailored design.
